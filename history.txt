Meeting Summary


Project break down is as follows.

Meeting date:
Attendance:
  1. Georges Hattab
  2. Ebenezer Awotoro


We came up with venn diagram to describe things we are looking forward to. The venn diagram was created to 
illustrate the relationship or enrichment between Mpstruc (Membrane Protein Strucuture) and PDB (Protein Data Bank) 
can be a useful visualization for understanding the overlap and differences between these two datasets. 
A Venn diagram is a set diagram that shows the overlap of sets, representing the common elements and unique elements in different datasets.

Here's a description of a hypothetical Venn diagram for Mpstruc and PDB enrichment:

Mpstruc Set (A):
=============
Circle A in the Venn diagram represents the set of membrane proteins from Mpstruc.
Label the circle as "Mpstruc."
This circle includes all membrane proteins obtained from the Mpstruc database.

PDB Set (B):
=============
Circle B in the Venn diagram represents the set of all proteins from the PDB.
Label the circle as "PDB."
This circle includes all proteins available in the Protein Data Bank.

Overlap (AB):
=========
The overlapping region between circles A and B represents the membrane proteins that are present in both Mpstruc and PDB.
Label the overlapping region with "Common Membrane Proteins."

Unique Regions:

The non-overlapping region in circle A represents membrane proteins unique to Mpstruc (not present in PDB).
We labeled this region as "Unique to Mpstruc."
The non-overlapping region in circle B represents proteins in PDB that are not membrane proteins.
We also labeled this region as "Non-membrane Proteins in PDB."

Interpretation:

If the overlap between Mpstruc and PDB is significant, it indicates a substantial number of membrane proteins that are shared between the two datasets.
If the unique region in Mpstruc is substantial, it suggests that Mpstruc contains membrane proteins that might not be present in PDB, highlighting its specificity to membrane proteins.
If the unique region in PDB is significant, it indicates proteins in PDB that are not membrane proteins.
This visual representation provides a quick overview of the relationship between membrane proteins in Mpstruc and all proteins in PDB. Adjustments can be made based on the actual datasets and specific criteria for membrane proteins in your analysis.




Development Stages Overview:

Stage 1:
----------------
Focus:Only MPstruct (analysis and visualization)
Example:
Tree diagrams
Visuals


Stage 2:
----------------
Focus: Only enriched MPstruct data (exclude MPstruct)
Example:
Generate summary statistics
Include relevant visualizations


Stage 3:
----------------
Focus: Integration of both curated MPstruct and enriched data.
  Tasks:
    1. Analyze and visualize data with respect to resolution methods.
    2. Also consider overlap with respect to methods
    3. Validate new/unclassified MP structures through clustering.
    4. Outlier detection.
    5. still counting...

Data separation based on methods used for protein resolution before analysis.


Recent Updates:

=====================
Issue Discovery:

Two membrane proteins listed on MPstruct cannot be found anywhere, including PDB.
Example: Entries with codes 7ROW and 7UUV are not found in the RCSB database.

There is an issue with : https://data.rcsb.org/rest/v1/core/entry/7ROW  Not found anywhere (Including PDB)
There is an issue with : https://data.rcsb.org/rest/v1/core/entry/7UUV  Not found anywhere (Including PDB)


Problematic Entries:

Certain codes in MPstruct have been updated on PDB, causing discrepancies.
Example: Entries like 5W7L have been replaced by new codes like 8G1N.

Each of these code are not available on RCSB (https://www.rcsb.org/structure/removed/3CJU).

Action Items:

Investigate discrepancies between MPstruct and PDB entries.
Update problematic entries with the correct replacements.










Recent update from my end:
================================

Two membrane proteins that were listed on MPstruct are nowhere to be found, I discovered while I was attempting to extract updates from the file again. for example:


There is an issue with : https://data.rcsb.org/rest/v1/core/entry/7ROW  Not found anywhere (Including PDB)
There is an issue with : https://data.rcsb.org/rest/v1/core/entry/7UUV  Not found anywhere (Including PDB)

The slightly problematic ones have already had their codes updated on PDB, however MPstruct retains the original protein code. Example
